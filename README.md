# Task Management System

## Overview
A CLI-based Task Management System that demonstrates four design patterns working together. Add tasks, view them in different formats, and delete completed tasks.

## Features
- Create simple or timed tasks (with due dates)
- View tasks in list, table, or priority-grouped format
- Apply smart decorations to highlight important tasks
- Delete tasks directly from the view interface
- Clean command-line interface with clear screen functionality

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Command-line interface (terminal/command prompt)

### Compilation Steps
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project root directory:
```
cd path/to/your/project
```
3. Compile the Java files:
```
javac src/main/java/taskmanager/*.java
```

### Running the Application
- To run the application, execute the `Main` class:
```
java -cp src/main/java taskmanager.Main
```

## Usage Guidelines
- Follow the on-screen prompts to add, view, or delete tasks.
- Use the designated commands for each action to ensure proper task management.

## Conclusion
This Task Management System serves as a practical example of how design patterns can be utilized in a real-world application. It provides a solid foundation for understanding OOP principles and design patterns in Java.
